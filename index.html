        <h2>South Korean cuisine</h2>
        <p>There is a cult of food in South Korea. Here they may not ask how you are doing, but they will ask if you ate well this morning or what you had for dinner yesterday. Going to a restaurant is the same type of leisure activity as going to a movie or a museum. In Korea they eat only in company, and therefore the portions are usually huge. During lunch or dinner, it is customary to share your dish and try someone else's, and it doesn't matter whether it's Korean kimchi chige or Italian carbonara.</p>
        <p>Korean cuisine in the form in which it exists now was finally formed during the war with Japan at the end of the 16th century. The Japanese brought new fruits and vegetables, the main one being red pepper. It is thanks to him that most Korean dishes can be described as “spicy and hot.” But still, the main feature of this cuisine is balance. An abundance of fresh vegetables, soybeans and herbs, seafood, the right combinations of ingredients, limited consumption of meat - all this makes Korean food also healthy.</p>
        <p>Must-try dishes in South Korea:</p>
        <p>Kimchi is a snack made from pickled Chinese cabbage with hot red pepper;</p>
        <p>Bibimbap is a dish of rice, meat or seafood, vegetables, spicy gochujang paste and eggs;</p>
        <p>Kimbap - Korean rolls;</p>
        <p>Samgyeopsal - bacon fried immediately before consumption on a special tabletop grill;</p>
        <p>Kalbi - barbecued beef ribs;</p>
        <p>Bulgogi - marinated meat fried over an open fire;</p>
        <p>Teokbokki - spicy rice cakes with various additives;</p>
        <p>Japchae - salad of noodles, vegetables, mushrooms and/or meat;</p>
        <p>Mantu - Korean dumplings;</p>
        <p>Samgyetang - chicken soup with rice and ginseng.</p>

        <h2>Transport of South Korea</h2>
        <p>Korea is a country with one of the most developed transport infrastructures not only in Asia, but also in the world. Transport works like a well-oiled machine, everything is clean, comfortable and completely safe to use. The service staff is extremely polite, ready to help with any question, and in addition, at airports, at large railway stations and in the metro, they are gradually becoming English-speaking.</p>
        <p>There are 6 international airports in Korea: Incheon, Gimhae, Jeonju, Daegu, Yangyang and Jeju. Incheon Airport, located near Seoul, serves flights to all parts of the world and is one of the best international hubs. Other airports serve Asian destinations. Domestic flights are operated by several airlines, including low cost ones.</p>
        <p>Passenger trains operated by the Korean National Railway are a very fast and reliable mode of transport.
            There are three types of trains: Sae Maeul Super Express, Mugunghwa Express Train, and Thongil Passenger Train.
            On weekends and holidays, trains are usually completely packed with passengers, so it is better to book and purchase tickets in advance.</p>
        <p>Sea cruises are one of the most interesting ways to travel around Korea. Ferries connect Busan and Jeju, Mokpo and Hongdo, Pohang and Ulleungdo and other cities along the waterways.
            Busan is the largest port and second largest city in the country. This international seaport is the main sea gate of Korea. Another international port is Incheon, which mostly serves shipping lines leading to China.</p>
        <p>The bus network is also well developed. There are three long-distance express bus terminals in Seoul, from where routes connecting the capital with other major cities in the country begin.
            City buses are the most common type of public transport. They run frequently and are relatively inexpensive.</p>
