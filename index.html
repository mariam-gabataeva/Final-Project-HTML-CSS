        <h2>South Korean cuisine</h2>
        <p>There is a cult of food in South Korea. Here they may not ask how you are doing, but they will ask if you ate well this morning or what you had for dinner yesterday. Going to a restaurant is the same type of leisure activity as going to a movie or a museum. In Korea they eat only in company, and therefore the portions are usually huge. During lunch or dinner, it is customary to share your dish and try someone else's, and it doesn't matter whether it's Korean kimchi chige or Italian carbonara.</p>
        <p>Korean cuisine in the form in which it exists now was finally formed during the war with Japan at the end of the 16th century. The Japanese brought new fruits and vegetables, the main one being red pepper. It is thanks to him that most Korean dishes can be described as “spicy and hot.” But still, the main feature of this cuisine is balance. An abundance of fresh vegetables, soybeans and herbs, seafood, the right combinations of ingredients, limited consumption of meat - all this makes Korean food also healthy.</p>
        <p>Must-try dishes in South Korea:</p>
        <p>Kimchi is a snack made from pickled Chinese cabbage with hot red pepper;</p>
        <p>Bibimbap is a dish of rice, meat or seafood, vegetables, spicy gochujang paste and eggs;</p>
        <p>Kimbap - Korean rolls;</p>
        <p>Samgyeopsal - bacon fried immediately before consumption on a special tabletop grill;</p>
        <p>Kalbi - barbecued beef ribs;</p>
        <p>Bulgogi - marinated meat fried over an open fire;</p>
        <p>Teokbokki - spicy rice cakes with various additives;</p>
        <p>Japchae - salad of noodles, vegetables, mushrooms and/or meat;</p>
        <p>Mantu - Korean dumplings;</p>
        <p>Samgyetang - chicken soup with rice and ginseng.</p>
